My father's name is <b>Mohd Shahrul Rizwan Bin Kasim</b> and he was born at <b>Selama, Kedah</b>. He was born in <b>14 June 1983</b>. My dad is someone who has always led by example, and one moment that stands out is when I was struggling with a school project as a kid. Late at night, when I was ready to give up, he sat beside me, patiently helping and encouraging me, saying, "We finish what we start." That simple act of support and his belief in perseverance stuck with me, shaping how I approach challenges to this day. It’s moments like these that remind me of his quiet strength and love.

<br><br>
My mother's name is <b>Erna Lisma Binti Elias</b> and was born at <b>Serdang, Kedah</b>. She was born in year  <b>1983, 31 January</b>. My mom is an independent woman who sells nasi lemak with passion and love. Despite the long hours and effort it takes, she always makes time to care for us, her children. I’ll never forget how she would pack extra food just to ensure we were never hungry, showing her unwavering love through every thoughtful act. Her strength and dedication inspire me every day.
